# Genome UI Development Challenge

## The Challenge

This repository contains a basic HTML site with an image and some copy. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to add some form of navigation structure on to the page so that a user can easily toggle between the four major copy sections on the page. The navigation pattern and design are completely up to you - take this challenge and run with it!

## The Rules

1. You must complete this challenge as a fork of this repository. You must have your final commit in to your forked version of this repository no later than 3 days after you fork the code.

2. All code in your fork must be your own. Use of existing libraries or frameworks is permitted, but you must be the one to implement/integrate the libraries into the site.

3. The original page content and banner image must be preserved. Any other aspects of layout can be added to/modified as needed.

4. The navigation structure must be developed from a mobile-first standpoint. It should be responsive and fully functional on both mobile and desktop browsers.

5. Site styling must be done using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). Do not modify the site CSS files directly.

## What We're Looking For

* Semantic HTML
* Clean code
* Compliance with basic accessibility standards (WCAG 2.0)
* An intuitive user interface
* Creativity, from both a design and a functionality standpoint
* Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility (for current versions of all major browsers)

## The Result

After going back and forth between using a framework I'm comfortable with already and one I can learn by doing this, I ended up going with Bootstrap in the interest of leading with my best foot. This task did prompt me, however, to take a deep dive into SASS -- and although I didn't end up needing many of its benefits (mixins, functions, etc) for this particular project, I nonetheless appreciate the learning opportunity.
